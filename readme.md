# About

Here is all our codes and records, include OpenCV experiment codes and the whole system on **Raspberry Pi** to communicate with **PLC**. All of them are written by python.

## Data Structure

* `CV_experiment`

    This folder puts some codes here, which are some ~~useless~~ experiments.

* `Main Struct`

    Mainly system run with **Raspberri Pi**.

* `Main Struct New`

    Same as **Main Struct**, but code are cleaner, and can input with **computer keyboard**.

* `solder_speed_experiment`

    Solder speed statistics and plots.

## Autostart

We use a `.sh` script file, every time the **Raspberry Pi** boots it will automatically start the system. Through we have graphic window, it needs to edit `/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart` to run our system rightly.
Add this line in the `autostart` file:

```bash
@sh /home/pi/autostart.sh
```
